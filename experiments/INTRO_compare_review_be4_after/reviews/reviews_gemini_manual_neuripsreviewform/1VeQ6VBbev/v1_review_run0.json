  "summary": "This paper analyzes policy gradient (PG) methods for finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), where optimal policies are non-stationary. It introduces 'Dynamic Policy Gradient' (Dynamic PG), a novel algorithm inspired by dynamic programming that learns policies backwards in time, from the final epoch to the first. The authors provide a theoretical convergence analysis for both Dynamic PG and the standard 'Simultaneous PG' (which learns all epochs' policies at once) in the tabular softmax setting. The analysis covers both exact and stochastic gradients, demonstrating that Dynamic PG achieves superior convergence bounds, particularly with respect to the time horizon H.",
  "strengths": [
    "The paper introduces Dynamic Policy Gradient, a conceptually appealing and intuitive algorithm that aligns policy gradient learning with the fundamental backwards-induction structure of dynamic programming for finite-horizon problems.",
    "The work provides the first, to our knowledge, rigorous convergence rate analysis comparing this dynamic, backwards-in-time training approach to the standard simultaneous approach for finite-horizon MDPs.",
    "The theoretical results for the exact gradient case are strong, demonstrating a significant improvement in sample complexity dependence on the horizon H (O(H^3) for Dynamic PG vs. O(H^5) for Simultaneous PG).",
    "A key theoretical insight for the Dynamic PG analysis is the ability to provide an explicit lower bound for the gradient domination constant (c_h = 1/|A| with uniform initialization), which is not known for the simultaneous case and may depend on H."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The paper's motivation and problem framing are weak. It fails to clearly articulate the specific technical challenges of analyzing PG in the finite-horizon setting (e.g., dealing with transient, non-stationary state-visitation measures) versus the well-studied infinite-horizon discounted setting (which relies on stationary distributions). This makes the contribution seem less significant than it is.",
    "The analysis is restricted to the tabular softmax setting. This limitation is not adequately discussed, especially since the proposed 'Dynamic PG' (Algorithm 2) seems far less practical for function approximation (e.g., neural networks) than the 'Simultaneous PG' baseline, as it requires H distinct parameter vectors.",
    "The comparison between the two methods is potentially unfair. The analysis for Simultaneous PG requires the strong 'Assumption 2' (constant state space S_h = S), while the Dynamic PG analysis does not appear to. This critical difference is not highlighted or discussed.",
    "The stochastic analysis, while technically novel, results in bounds that are admittedly 'far from tight and irrelevant for practical implementations' (e.g., K ~ N^3 ~ H^30). The analysis relies on a stopping time defined relative to the *exact* gradient path, limiting its practical implications.",
    "The empirical comparison in Figure 1 is ambiguous. The x-axis ('number of gradient steps') does not account for the fact that a single gradient computation for Simultaneous PG (w.r.t. all parameters) is likely H times more expensive than for Dynamic PG (w.r.t. a single $\\theta_h$). A comparison based on total computational cost is needed."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Could you explicitly detail the technical difficulties introduced by the finite-horizon's non-stationary state-visitation measures, and how the Dynamic PG's one-step-at-a-time analysis (akin to a contextual bandit) successfully circumvents the distribution-mismatch-over-time problem that complicates the Simultaneous PG analysis?",
    "How would the Dynamic PG algorithm (Algorithm 2) be implemented in a non-tabular setting with function approximation, such as a single neural network $f_\\theta(s, h)$? Would this not re-introduce the parameter-coupling across time that the simultaneous approach has, and how would this affect the 'backwards' training?",
    "Please clarify the x-axis in Figure 1. Does 'number of gradient steps' mean 'updates to any $\\theta_h$' or 'full updates to all parameters'? A plot normalized by total FLOPs or total parameter updates (e.g., $\\sum |\\theta_h| \\times N_h$) would provide a fairer comparison of computational efficiency.",
    "Why does the Simultaneous PG analysis require the strong Assumption 2 (S_h = S), and does the Dynamic PG analysis also require it? If not, this is a significant advantage for the dynamic approach that should be emphasized.",
    "Given the impracticality of the stochastic bounds, could variance reduction techniques be applied more effectively to the Dynamic PG structure than to the Simultaneous one, potentially leading to tighter, more practical bounds?"
  ],
  "limitations_and_societal_impact": "The paper's primary limitation, its reliance on a tabular setting, is mentioned in the conclusion but its deep implications are not adequately explored. The authors should explicitly discuss *why* their Dynamic PG algorithm is difficult to scale with function approximation, as it relies on H distinct parameter sets, presenting a major barrier to practical application. The paper does not discuss societal impacts, which is acceptable as the work is purely theoretical and foundational.",
