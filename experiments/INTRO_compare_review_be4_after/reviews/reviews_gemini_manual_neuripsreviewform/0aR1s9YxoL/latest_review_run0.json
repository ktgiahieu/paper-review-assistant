  "summary": "This paper investigates plasticity loss in visual reinforcement learning (VRL) by systematically examining three aspects: data, modules, and training stages. The authors conclude that: (1) data augmentation (DA) is essential for maintaining plasticity, (2) the critic module's plasticity loss is the primary training bottleneck, not the encoder, and (3) this loss is catastrophic if not addressed in the early training stages. Based on these findings, they propose 'Adaptive RR', a method that improves sample efficiency by starting with a low replay ratio (RR) and increasing it only after the critic's plasticity, measured by the Fraction of Active Units (FAU), has recovered.",
  "strengths": [
    "The paper addresses the critical and timely problem of plasticity loss, a key obstacle to sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning.",
    "The systematic decomposition of the problem into 'Data', 'Modules', and 'Stages' provides a clear, logical narrative and analytical framework.",
    "The central claim that the critic's plasticity, rather than the encoder's representation, is the main bottleneck is a significant and non-obvious finding that challenges a common focus in VRL research.",
    "The distinction between 'catastrophic' early-stage plasticity loss and 'benign' later-stage loss (Section 5) is a novel and useful conceptual contribution.",
    "The proposed method, Adaptive RR, is a simple, intuitive, and practical application of the paper's core insights, demonstrating improved sample efficiency.",
    "The experiments using a frozen pre-trained encoder (Fig 4) and plasticity injection (Fig 5) provide compelling evidence to de-emphasize the role of representation learning as the primary bottleneck."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The paper's central claims (e.g., critic as bottleneck, efficacy of DA) rely almost exclusively on the Fraction of Active Units (FAU) as a proxy for plasticity. This metric is insufficient and can be misleading, as noted in foundational plasticity literature (e.g., Lyle et al., 2023).",
    "The empirical validation for the core diagnostic claims in Sections 3-5 is limited, often showing results for only one (Quadruped Run) or three DMC tasks, which weakens the generality of the findings.",
    "The comparison of DA to other interventions (Figure 2) is critically incomplete as it omits ReDo (Sokar et al., 2023), the most relevant baseline for mitigating dormant neurons, which FAU directly measures.",
    "The Adaptive RR method's switching mechanism is a heuristic (FAU difference < 0.001) presented without a sensitivity analysis. The paper fails to explore its robustness to this threshold or the check interval.",
    "The paper omits discussion of closely related concurrent work, such as DrM (ICLR 2024), which also proposes an adaptive mechanism based on plasticity metrics to address the high RR dilemma."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "The paper's core claims rest heavily on FAU. Can the authors validate their key findings from Sections 3-5 (e.g., critic as bottleneck, DA's role) using alternative plasticity metrics like feature rank, weight norm, or gradient-based curvature analysis?",
    "How sensitive is Adaptive RR's performance to the '0.001' threshold and the '50 episode' check interval? A sensitivity analysis is needed to prove this heuristic is robust and not-overly tuned to the tested environments.",
    "Figure 2 claims DA is the most effective intervention but omits ReDo. Can the authors add a direct comparison to ReDo in this experiment to properly situate DA's effectiveness against SOTA plasticity-maintenance techniques?",
    "How does Adaptive RR conceptually and empirically differ from concurrent work like DrM, which also adapts training based on a plasticity metric (dormant neuron ratio)? A dedicated discussion is needed.",
    "The 'Plasticity Injection' diagnostic (Figure 5) is key evidence. Can the authors clarify its exact implementation (is it a re-implementation of Nikishin et al., 2024?) and discuss its limitations as a diagnostic tool?"
  ],
  "limitations_and_societal_impact": "The paper includes a 'Limitations' section that appropriately identifies the limited scope of environments (DMC and Atari) and the simplicity of the Adaptive RR mechanism. The societal impact of this fundamental algorithmic work is not discussed, which is acceptable. The authors could briefly note that improving sample efficiency is a key enabler for real-world applications of RL (e.g., robotics), which in turn have broad societal implications.",
