  "summary": "This paper empirically investigates plasticity loss in visual reinforcement learning (VRL) by analyzing three components: data, agent modules, and training stages. The authors posit that: (1) data augmentation is the primary mechanism for preserving plasticity; (2) the critic's plasticity loss, not the encoder's, is the main bottleneck for sample efficiency; and (3) this loss is catastrophic and irrecoverable if not addressed in the early stages of training. Based on these insights, the paper proposes 'Adaptive RR', a method that starts with a low replay ratio (RR) and dynamically increases it only after the critic's plasticity (measured by Fraction of Active Units) has recovered, thereby improving sample efficiency.",
  "strengths": [
    "The paper provides a clear, systematic, and well-structured empirical study that builds a compelling narrative across data, modules, and training stages.",
    "The conceptual shift from the commonly-blamed encoder (representation) bottleneck to the critic (plasticity) bottleneck is an important and insightful contribution to the VRL discourse.",
    "The diagnostic experiments are well-designed, particularly the factorial analysis of Data Augmentation vs. Reset (Fig. 1) and the use of Plasticity Injection (Fig. 7) to isolate the critic's role.",
    "The proposed 'Adaptive RR' method is a logical and practical application of the paper's core findings, offering a novel solution to the well-known 'high RR dilemma'.",
    "The paper is exceptionally well-written and presented, with clear figures that effectively support the main arguments."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The paper's central claims hinge almost entirely on the 'Fraction of Active Units' (FAU) as the sole metric for plasticity. This is a significant methodological flaw, as FAU is an imperfect proxy and can be misleading, a limitation the authors even note in their own appendix.",
    "The study fails to compare against crucial, state-of-the-art baselines for mitigating plasticity loss, most notably ReDo (Sokar et al., 2023), which directly addresses the dormant neuron phenomenon that FAU is intended to measure.",
    "The mechanism for 'Adaptive RR' is not sufficiently detailed for reproducibility. The trigger—a change in FAU below 0.001—is vague about the checkpoint interval, averaging, and sensitivity, making it hard to reimplement.",
    "The empirical validation is limited to the DeepMind Control suite. The paper's strong claims about the fundamental nature of plasticity in VRL are not substantiated without evidence from more diverse domains, such as the Atari-100k benchmark.",
    "The paper does not adequately discuss or compare against relevant concurrent work that also investigates module-specific dormancy and plasticity, such as DrM.",
    "The argument that DA's *primary* role is plasticity preservation, rather than simply improving representation learning (which in turn stabilizes the critic), is not fully disentangled."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Your central claims rest on FAU. How do these claims—particularly the critic-as-bottleneck (Fig 3-5) and the irrecoverable early-stage loss (Fig 8)—hold when plasticity is measured using orthogonal metrics like feature rank, weight norm, or Hessian-based curvature analysis?",
    "Given that your method is motivated by mitigating plasticity loss, a direct comparison to established mitigation techniques is necessary. How does 'Adaptive RR' compare in sample efficiency against a strong baseline like ReDo?",
    "For reproducibility, please provide a precise algorithm or pseudocode for 'Adaptive RR'. What is the exact checkpointing frequency (in environment steps), and is the 0.001 threshold applied to raw FAU values or a moving average?",
    "The 'turning on DA' experiment (Fig 8) is a key support for the 'irrecoverable loss' claim. However, this could also be interpreted as the agent having already converged to a poor, un-augmented data distribution. How can you definitively attribute this to plasticity loss rather than a distribution shift problem?",
    "Have you considered an alternative hypothesis: that DA's primary role is improving the encoder's representations, and this *stabilization of the learning target* is what prevents the critic's plasticity loss, rather than DA acting on the critic directly?"
  ],
  "limitations_and_societal_impact": "The authors acknowledge limitations regarding the narrowness of tasks (DMC only) and the simplicity of their proposed method. However, they critically fail to identify the paper's most significant limitation: the methodological over-reliance on the Fraction of Active Units (FAU) as a comprehensive metric for plasticity. This unacknowledged assumption weakens the confidence in their conclusions. The paper does not discuss societal impact, which is acceptable for this type of foundational research.",
