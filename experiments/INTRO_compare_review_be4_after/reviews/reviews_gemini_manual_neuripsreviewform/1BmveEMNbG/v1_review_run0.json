  "summary": "This paper investigates complex query answering on knowledge graphs, focusing on Existential First Order (${\\textsc{EFO}_1}$) queries. It first provides a rigorous logical analysis that distinguishes the full ${\\textsc{EFO}_1}$ class from the 'Tree-Form' (TF) queries solvable by prior query embedding methods. It identifies a 'gap' (e.g., cyclic, multigraph, and other query structures) and introduces a new benchmark dataset of 10 query types to test this gap. Finally, it proposes FIT, an inference algorithm based on fuzzy logic and pre-trained neural link predictors, to answer these more complex queries.",
  "strengths": [
    "The paper provides an excellent and much-needed formal analysis (Section 3) distinguishing the 'Tree-Form' (TF) queries solved by operator-tree methods from the full ${\\textsc{EFO}_1}$ class.",
    "The insight that TF queries are not a subset of ${\\textsc{EFO}_1}$ due to the definition of negation (Proposition 2) is a strong conceptual contribution that clarifies the literature.",
    "The introduction of a new dataset with 10 challenging query types (cyclic, multigraph, existential leaves) is a valuable contribution for testing the limits of CQA models.",
    "The proposed FIT algorithm shows strong performance on existing benchmarks (Tables 2 & 4) when compared to other inference methods like CQD and LMPNN using the same underlying link predictor."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The paper's primary methodological weakness is the failure to discuss or compare against FuzzQE (Bai et al., AAAI-22). FuzzQE appears to be a nearly identical approach, also using fuzzy logic $t$-norms and $t$-conorms over pre-trained link predictors for CQA.",
    "The omission of FuzzQE invalidates the paper's central claim of novelty for the FIT algorithm and renders all empirical claims of 'outperforming previous methods' (Abstract) unsubstantiated, as the most relevant state-of-the-art baseline is absent.",
    "The entire framework relies on converting queries to DNF (Definition 6). This is a severe, unacknowledged limitation, as DNF conversion can lead to an exponential blowup in formula size, making the approach intractable for many 'arbitrary' ${\\textsc{EFO}_1}$ query structures.",
    "The solution for cyclic graphs (Step 5) is a heuristic enumeration over the top-M candidates. This is an approximation, not an exact solution, and its computational cost is unanalyzed but potentially exponential in the query's treewidth.",
    "The experiment on the new dataset (Table 1) is a strawman. It compares FIT to operator-tree baselines on queries they are definitionally incapable of solving, rather than against a comparable method."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Please explicitly detail the methodological differences between FIT and FuzzQE (Bai et al., AAAI-22) and provide a full experimental comparison against it on both the new and existing datasets.",
    "How do you address the known issue of exponential formula growth when converting arbitrary ${\\textsc{EFO}_1}$ queries to Disjunctive Normal Form? What is the practical limit on query structures FIT can handle?",
    "Please provide a formal complexity analysis for the cyclic graph enumeration (Step 5). How does performance (both MRR and runtime) degrade as the graph's cyclomatic complexity increases and the hyperparameter $M$ is varied?",
    "Theorem 6 (Faithfulness) only applies to negation-free queries. What are the theoretical guarantees for queries with negation, and how does the choice of $t$-norm for conjunction (product) interact with the $1-T(\\phi)$ negation?"
  ],
  "limitations_and_societal_impact": "The authors do not include a limitations section. The primary limitations, which must be addressed, are: (1) The exponential complexity of DNF conversion for certain query structures. (2) The heuristic, approximate, and potentially non-scalable nature of the cycle-handling algorithm (Step 5). (3) The method's complete dependence on the quality and calibration of the upstream neural link predictor. Societal impacts are not discussed but are minimal, standard for KG reasoning research.",
