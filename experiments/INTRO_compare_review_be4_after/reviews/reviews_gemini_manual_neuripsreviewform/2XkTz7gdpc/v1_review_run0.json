  "summary": "The paper proposes a new graph generative model based on a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine process. It learns to reverse a graph coarsening sequence. Generation starts from a single node and iteratively applies a learned model to (1) expand nodes into clusters and (2) refine the resulting local connectivity using a denoising diffusion model. The method introduces a 'Local PPGN' architecture, a computationally efficient variant of PPGN, and claims state-of-the-art performance, subquadratic scaling, and novel extrapolation capabilities to out-of-distribution graph sizes.",
  "strengths": [
    "The core generative process, which models graph generation as the inverse of a coarsening sequence, is principled and well-suited for capturing multi-scale graph structures.",
    "The model's ability to extrapolate to out-of-distribution graph sizes (Figure 3) is a significant and novel result, likely due to the model's iterative, locally-scoped operations.",
    "The introduction of 'Local PPGN' is a strong architectural contribution, thoughtfully designed to be expressive on the locally-dense graphs created during expansion while remaining computationally efficient.",
    "The use of a denoising diffusion model to jointly learn the expansion (node splitting) and refinement (edge pruning) steps is a powerful and effective choice.",
    "The empirical subquadratic scaling (Figure 6) is promising, demonstrating clear advantages over baseline one-shot and simple autoregressive models."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The method is currently restricted to generating un-attributed graphs (no node/edge features), which is a major limitation. This prevents evaluation on standard, widely-used benchmarks like QM9 or ZINC and severely narrows the method's practical applicability.",
    "The experimental comparison is incomplete. It omits several critical and state-of-the-art baselines for scalable/hierarchical graph generation (e.g., HiGen, GraphGen, Unpooling-GAN), making the state-of-the-art claims on large graphs unsubstantiated.",
    "The paper's framing as the 'first graph generative method based on iterative local expansion' is questionable. The coarse-to-fine generative paradigm is a known concept in hierarchical graph generation; the paper's novelty lies in its specific *instantiation* (spectral coarsening + diffusion + Local PPGN).",
    "There is a contradiction between the paper's heavy emphasis on 'Spectral Guided Generation' (Sec 3.2.3) and the ablation study (Appendix 9.1, Table 2), which shows that a random coarsening cost function performs comparably. This undermines the claimed importance of the spectral-preserving component.",
    "The theoretical complexity analysis in Appendix 13 rests on assumptions (e.g., bounds on edge/triangle counts in intermediate graphs) that are not rigorously proven, though the empirical scaling is strong."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Could you clarify the practical and theoretical barriers to extending the method to graphs with node and edge features? This seems to require a fundamentally different coarsening and refinement model, e.g., based on feature-aware coarsening schemes.",
    "Please provide a more thorough comparison against other scalable, hierarchical baselines like HiGen and Unpooling-GAN, as their omission leaves a significant gap in the experimental validation.",
    "Given the ablation in Table 2, can you reconcile the finding that random coarsening is competitive with the strong emphasis on spectral-preserving methods? Does this suggest the hierarchical framework itself, rather than the spectral guidance, is the primary source of performance gain?",
    "The 'Local PPGN' is designed for the locally-dense graphs from Definition 1. Have you analyzed the density (e.g., triangle counts) of the intermediate graphs $`\\tilde{G}_l`$ and how this empirically affects the runtime, particularly in relation to the $`\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n+m)`$ complexity claim?"
  ],
  "limitations_and_societal_impact": "The paper fails to adequately discuss its most significant limitation in the main text: its inability to handle attributed graphs. This is a major restriction on its applicability to real-world problems (e.g., molecular generation) and must be clearly stated as a core limitation, not just future work. The societal impact is not discussed, which is acceptable for this type of foundational research. A brief note on potential misuse (e.g., generating synthetic relational data for disinformation) could be added but is not critical.",
