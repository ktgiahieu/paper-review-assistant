  "summary": "This paper tackles the problem of 'intervention extrapolation,' which involves predicting an outcome $Y$ under unseen values of an action $A$. The authors assume a causal graph $A \\to Z \\to (X, Y)$, where $Z$ is a latent variable, $X$ is its observed, non-linear, and noise-free transformation ($X=g_0(Z)$), and $Y$ is the outcome. The key assumptions are that the effect of $A$ on $Z$ is linear ($E[Z|A] = M_0 A$) and the map $g_0$ is injective. The paper proposes 'Rep4Ex', a two-stage method. First, it learns a representation $\\phi(X)$ that identifies $Z$ up to an affine map using an autoencoder with a novel 'linear invariance' regularizer (AE-MMR), which is based on Maximum Moment Restriction (MMR). Second, it uses this learned representation in a control function (CF) framework to estimate the non-linear extrapolation $E[Y|\\text{do}(A=a^*)]$, even in the presence of confounding between $Z$ and $Y$. The authors provide theoretical proofs for identifiability and extrapolation and validate the method on synthetic data.",
  "strengths": [
    "The paper addresses the important and challenging problem of out-of-support intervention extrapolation, connecting it to causal representation learning.",
    "The theoretical linkage between a linear $A \\to Z$ relationship and the affine identifiability of $Z$ via the 'linear invariance' constraint (Theorem 2) is novel.",
    "The proposed AE-MMR method provides a practical, kernel-based regularizer to enforce this linear invariance constraint, which is an interesting methodological contribution.",
    "The two-stage Rep4Ex-CF approach, combining identifiable representation learning with a control function estimator, is a principled and coherent framework.",
    "The synthetic experiments (e.g., Fig. 4/6) clearly demonstrate the failure of naive extrapolation and the success of the proposed method *when its assumptions are met*."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The identifiability theory (Theorem 2) and the proposed AE-MMR method are critically dependent on two highly restrictive and often unrealistic assumptions: (1) a noise-free, injective mixing function $X = g_0(Z)$, and (2) a strictly linear effect $E[Z|A] = M_0 A$.",
    "The paper fails to analyze or even discuss the robustness of the method if these strong assumptions are even slightly violated (e.g., by small observation noise on $X$ or minor non-linearities in $A \\to Z$).",
    "The framework provides no practical diagnostic for a user to verify if these two critical assumptions hold, rendering the method difficult to apply to real-world data.",
    "The extrapolation power relies on another strong, unverified assumption: the noise $V$ in the $Z$ process must have full support ($\\text{supp}(V) = \\mathbb{R}^d$), as stated in Setting 1.",
    "The experimental comparison for the primary extrapolation task (e.g., Fig 4, 5) uses a non-extrapolating MLP as the main baseline, which is a strawman. Comparisons against other representation learning methods (VAE, AE-Vanilla) are limited to the representation quality ($R^2$) and not the downstream extrapolation error."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Could the authors provide a robustness analysis? For example, how does AE-MMR's $R^2$ (Fig. 3) and Rep4Ex-CF's MSE (Fig. 5) degrade as observation noise ($X = g_0(Z) + \\epsilon_X$) or non-linearity (e.g., $Z = M_0 A + f(A) + V$) is introduced with increasing magnitude?",
    "The noise-free, injective $X=g_0(Z)$ assumption precludes the use of this method in settings where $Z$ is a low-dimensional semantic space and $X$ are high-dimensional pixels. How could the 'linear invariance' constraint be adapted for a probabilistic decoder $p(X|Z)$, such as in a VAE?",
    "How would this method compare to related frameworks like Anchor Regression (Rothenh√§usler et al., 2021) or non-linear IV methods, which also leverage exogenous variables for robust prediction?",
    "What is the justification for using a deterministic AE over a VAE, given that the VAE framework is more naturally suited to handling observation noise, which is a key limitation of the current method?",
    "The control function stage assumes additivity ($E[Y|\\phi(X), V_{\\phi}] = \\nu(\\phi(X)) + \\psi(V_{\\phi})$). How sensitive is the extrapolation to violations of this additive separability?"
  ],
  "limitations_and_societal_impact": "The authors do not adequately address the severe limitations imposed by their assumptions. The paper's core claims of identifiability and extrapolation *rely* on a noise-free, injective $X=g_0(Z)$ mapping and a linear $A \\to Z$ effect. These assumptions are unlikely to hold in most complex, real-world problems where representation learning is needed. The paper should explicitly state that the method is designed for this specific, highly-structured setting and that its validity breaks down without these assumptions. A discussion of how to *test* these assumptions is critically absent. The paper does not discuss societal impact, which is acceptable given its theoretical nature.",
