  "summary": "This paper investigates the relationship between label smoothing (LS) and model privacy, specifically concerning model inversion attacks (MIAs). The authors empirically demonstrate a dual effect: standard positive LS (α > 0) increases model vulnerability to MIAs by creating more discriminative and tightly clustered embedding spaces, especially in low-data regimes. Conversely, they propose using negative LS (α < 0) as a novel and effective defense, showing it disrupts the attack's optimization process by creating unstable gradients and a less separated embedding space. The paper introduces a new 'Knowledge Extraction' metric and provides results across multiple MIA types and datasets.",
  "strengths": [
    "The paper identifies a novel and important link between a common regularization technique (label smoothing) and a significant privacy threat (model inversion attacks).",
    "The core finding is counter-intuitive and valuable: a method (positive LS) that improves generalization can simultaneously harm privacy by making the feature space *easier* to invert.",
    "The proposal of negative label smoothing as a defense is simple, practical (requires no architectural changes), and shown to be highly effective, outperforming SOTA defenses like MID and BiDO in the presented experiments.",
    "The analysis of *why* the methods work is strong, particularly the ablation on PPA's stages (showing gradient destabilization) and the t-SNE visualizations (showing cluster separation/overlap).",
    "The introduction of the 'Knowledge Extraction Score' is a thoughtful new metric for evaluating the functional success of an inversion attack.",
    "The empirical evaluation is broad, covering both high-resolution (PPA) and low-resolution (GMI, KED, etc.) attacks, as well as comparisons to SOTA defenses (MID, BiDO)."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The central claim of a 'better utility-privacy trade-off' is fundamentally confounded. The experiments do not control for model utility (Test Accuracy). For example, in Table 1, the negative LS model (91.5% Acc) is compared to a baseline (94.9% Acc) and a positive LS model (97.4% Acc). The observed 'defense' from negative LS may simply be a trivial consequence of its lower accuracy, not a genuine privacy-preserving mechanism. This invalidates the primary trade-off comparison.",
    "The paper's main body is overly focused on the PPA attack. Critical results for other SOTA MIAs (GMI, KED, BREP-MI) are relegated to the appendix. The finding that the label-only BREP-MI attack is *unaffected* by LS is a major caveat that should be in the main paper to properly scope the claims.",
    "The paper fails to discuss the trade-off with other critical model properties. Positive LS is known to improve calibration and adversarial robustness. The paper notes negative LS harms calibration (a known trade-off for privacy) but omits any analysis of its effect on adversarial robustness, backdoor vulnerability, or other security vectors.",
    "The paper lacks a formal theoretical explanation for the observed phenomena. While the mechanistic insights (gradients, clusters) are good, there is no formal linkage (e.g., via information theory) between the smoothing factor α and a bound on information leakage, which the authors concede is a limitation."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "To de-confound utility and privacy, can you re-run the core experiments (e.g., for Table 1) using early stopping or other methods to ensure all models (baseline, positive LS, negative LS, MID, BiDO) achieve *identical* test accuracy? This is essential to validate the trade-off claim.",
    "Given the finding that negative LS harms calibration (high ECE), and knowing positive LS can improve adversarial robustness, what is the impact of negative LS on adversarial robustness? A simple PGD attack evaluation would make the 'trade-off' analysis much more complete.",
    "The finding that label-only BREP-MI is unaffected is critical. Can you please move this result from the appendix to the main paper and explicitly revise the abstract and conclusion to state that negative LS is a defense against *confidence- and gradient-based* MIAs?",
    "The training schedule for negative LS (gradual increase) seems important for stability. How sensitive is the final utility-privacy trade-off to this schedule? Does a different schedule yield an even better result?"
  ],
  "limitations_and_societal_impact": "The authors adequately discuss the high computational cost of MIAs as a limitation. They are also transparent about the lack of a formal theoretical framework, which is commendable. The societal impact is clearly articulated in the introduction (e.g., facial recognition security). The primary unaddressed limitation is the scope of the 'trade-off'—the paper frames it as utility-vs-privacy, but it is at least a utility-privacy-calibration triangle. The impact on other security aspects like adversarial robustness is a critical, unaddressed dimension.",
