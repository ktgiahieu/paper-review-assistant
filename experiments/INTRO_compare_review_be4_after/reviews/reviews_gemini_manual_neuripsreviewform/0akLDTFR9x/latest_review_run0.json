  "summary": "This paper proposes Temporal Difference (TD) InfoNCE, a novel, off-policy algorithm for contrastive representation learning in time-series data. The core idea is to derive a TD-based estimator for the InfoNCE (contrastive predictive coding) objective, which allows the model to learn from partial trajectories and 'stitch' together different pieces of data. This approach is presented as a function-approximated, implicit version of the Successor Representation. The authors apply this method to goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), demonstrating significant improvements in sample efficiency in tabular settings and superior performance on challenging online and offline GCRL benchmarks, particularly in stochastic environments.",
  "strengths": [
    "The paper provides a novel and well-motivated derivation of a temporal difference (TD) estimator for the InfoNCE loss, bridging the gap between contrastive learning and TD methods.",
    "The connection drawn to the Successor Representation (SR) is insightful, framing the method as a scalable, function-approximated approach to learning SRs implicitly.",
    "The empirical results are strong and comprehensive. The massive sample efficiency gains (e.g., 1500x vs. MC InfoNCE) in tabular settings clearly validate the core hypothesis.",
    "The gridworld 'stitching' and 'shortcut' experiments (Fig. 8, 11, 12) provide excellent, intuitive qualitative evidence for the off-policy, dynamic-programming-like behavior of TD InfoNCE compared to its Monte Carlo counterpart.",
    "The method shows superior performance over strong baselines (like QRL) on complex GCRL tasks, especially in the stochastic setting (Fig. 6), which aligns with the theoretical properties of TD-based averaging.",
    "The algorithm demonstrates strong performance in the offline RL setting (Table 1), highlighting the practical utility of its off-policy formulation."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "A significant theoretical gap exists between the practical algorithm (Eq. 9) and the 'variant' analyzed in the convergence proof (Eq. 12, Appendix 6).",
    "The practical algorithm (Eq. 9) uses finite-sample, batch-based estimates for the softmax normalizer and the importance weights, which introduces bias. The paper does not analyze how this bias from nested Monte Carlo estimation affects the convergence or the fixed point of the algorithm.",
    "The claim of being 20x more sample efficient than the Successor Representation (Fig 7) is not adequately explained. Since the tabular SR is also a TD method, the source of this significant improvement (e.g., function approximation, sampling) is unclear.",
    "The term 'non-parametric' is used confusingly (e.g., Fig 1 caption). The method is parametric (uses neural networks); it appears the authors mean 'implicit' or 'function-approximated' rather than 'non-parametric' in the statistical sense."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Can you formalize the relationship between the practical objective (Eq. 9) and the analyzed objective (Eq. 12)? Specifically, can you bound the bias introduced by the finite-sample estimation of the normalizing constant in the importance weight `w`?",
    "Could you please elaborate on the 20x sample efficiency gain over the Successor Representation baseline? Is this baseline a tabular SR? If so, is the gain due to the implicit compression of the function approximator (`d << |S|`) providing better generalization?",
    "In the practical algorithm (App 9.1), the importance weight `W` is computed using target networks, a crucial detail for stability. How does performance change if `W` is computed with the online critic, and how sensitive is the algorithm to the target network update frequency?",
    "Have you considered the connection to other implicit TD methods? For example, how does this method relate to learning a 'critic' on the density ratio `p^Ï€ / p` itself, as seen in offline RL methods like GradientDICE?"
  ],
  "limitations_and_societal_impact": "The authors adequately address limitations. They explicitly acknowledge the theoretical gap between the implemented loss and the proven convergence, the practical complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity, and the fact that the method still struggles with the most complex image-based tasks. They do not discuss societal impact, but for this foundational algorithmic work, the direct negative impacts are not immediately apparent. Its omission is not a major flaw.",
