  "summary": "This paper introduces SCOTCH, a novel structure learning method that combines neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with variational inference to infer causal structures from continuous-time temporal data. The method addresses limitations of existing discrete-time approaches by naturally handling irregular sampling intervals and modeling intrinsic stochasticity, with theoretical guarantees on structural identifiability and consistency, plus comprehensive empirical validation.",
  "strengths": [
    "Strong theoretical contributions: The paper provides rigorous identifiability theorems for both observational and latent SDE formulations, along with consistency guarantees for the variational inference framework in the infinite data limit. The proofs are technically sound and well-structured.",
    "Well-motivated methodology: The paper clearly articulates limitations of ODE-based methods (e.g., NGM) through concrete failure cases (bimodal SDE), demonstrating why SDEs are necessary for capturing multimodal trajectories and non-Gaussian distributions.",
    "Comprehensive experimental validation: Extensive experiments across synthetic datasets (Lorenz, Glycolysis), semi-synthetic benchmarks (DREAM3), and real-world data (Netsim) with multiple baseline comparisons and proper handling of irregular sampling scenarios.",
    "Handles practical considerations: The method naturally accommodates irregular sampling intervals without requiring imputation, a significant practical advantage over discrete-time methods.",
    "Clear presentation: The paper is generally well-written with good motivation, clear problem formulation, and comprehensive appendices with implementation details and additional experimental results."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Strong restrictive assumptions: The diagonal diffusion assumption (Assumption 2) is a significant limitation that the authors acknowledge but don't fully justify. This rules out many real systems with coupled noise terms and is stronger than necessary for many identifiability results.",
    "Limited scalability: The method scales linearly with sequence length, which the authors acknowledge. No experiments exceed 100 time points, limiting applicability to long time series common in modern applications.",
    "Cannot model instantaneous effects: A fundamental limitation acknowledged by the authors. Many real systems exhibit instantaneous causal effects, and this exclusion reduces practical applicability compared to Rhino.",
    "Non-stationary systems not supported: The time-homogeneous SDE assumption prevents application to many real-world systems with time-varying dynamics. The authors suggest time embeddings might help but would break theoretical guarantees.",
    "Incomplete experimental comparisons: (1) NGM and CUTS were not originally designed for multiple time series; concatenation is a heuristic fix without principled justification. (2) The LSDE baseline is somewhat artificial and doesn't represent a standard alternative approach. (3) Some results show SCOTCH underperforming Rhino on Netsim (0.95 vs 0.99 AUROC), suggesting discrete models may be more appropriate for some datasets.",
    "Computational complexity not thoroughly analyzed: While the paper mentions linear scaling with sequence length, detailed runtime comparisons with baselines are absent. Training uses 30,000 epochs for some datasets, suggesting potential inefficiency.",
    "Variational inference tightness: Assumption 2 (expressive posterior) is non-constructive and doesn't guarantee the ELBO is sufficiently tight in practice. No empirical validation of how tight the bound is during training."

  "detailed_comments": "This is a well-executed paper with solid theoretical contributions and comprehensive experiments. The combination of SDEs with structure learning is novel and addresses real limitations of prior ODE-based methods. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, establishing structural identifiability and consistency. However, several limitations temper the contribution: (1) the diagonal diffusion assumption is restrictive, (2) inability to handle instantaneous effects reduces practical scope, (3) limited scalability and non-stationarity support, and (4) some experimental choices (concatenation, LSDE baseline) are questionable. The experiments are comprehensive but show that SCOTCH doesn't universally dominateâ€”Rhino performs better on Netsim, suggesting the choice between discrete and continuous models depends on the system. Despite these limitations, the paper makes sufficient contributions to merit publication at a top venue, particularly for its theoretical insights and clear exposition of when continuous-time SDE models are preferable to deterministic ODE or discrete alternatives.",
