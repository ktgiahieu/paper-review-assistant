  "summary": "This paper introduces SCOTCH, a structure learning method combining neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with variational inference to infer causal graphs from continuous-time observational data. The approach handles irregular sampling intervals and provides theoretical guarantees for structural identifiability and consistency, with empirical validation on synthetic and real datasets.",
  "strengths": [
    "Novel theoretical contributions with rigorous proofs of structural identifiability for SDEs under diagonal diffusion assumptions and consistency guarantees for the variational formulation in the infinite data limit",
    "Well-motivated problem addressing key limitations of existing discrete-time methods (NGM, Rhino) that struggle with irregular sampling and continuous processes; the bimodal failure case effectively demonstrates NGM's limitations",
    "Comprehensive experimental evaluation across multiple datasets (Lorenz-96, Glycolysis, DREAM3, Netsim) with consistent improvements over strong baselines including constraint-based (PCMCI+), Granger causality (CUTS), and recent continuous-time methods (NGM)",
    "Technically sound framework combining established techniques (variational inference via Girsanov theorem, neural SDEs) in a novel way with clear mathematical exposition and detailed architecture descriptions",
    "Practical handling of irregular sampling through continuous-time formulation is more principled than imputation approaches used by baselines"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Critical limitation: Cannot model instantaneous effects (acknowledged by authors), which is common in real systems. This significantly restricts applicability compared to Rhino and limits the models the approach can learn",
    "Scalability concerns: Linear computational complexity in time series length could be prohibitive for long sequences. Proposed solution (encoder network) is left as future work, limiting practical applicability",
    "Strong assumptions required for theoretical guarantees: Global Lipschitz continuity, diagonal diffusion functions, and correctly specified models are restrictive. The diagonal diffusion assumption particularly constrains the class of learnable systems",
    "Experimental setup concerns: Multiple time series concatenation for fair comparison with NGM/CUTS is somewhat ad-hoc and may not reflect realistic learning scenarios; some datasets relatively small (Netsim: 5 series, DREAM3: 21 observations)",
    "Incomplete analysis of failure modes: Limited discussion of when assumptions are violated; performance degrades substantially on Netsim at higher irregularity (p=0.2), suggesting brittleness not thoroughly investigated"

  "detailed_comments": "SCOTCH presents solid technical contributions with novel theory and improved empirical performance over baselines. The structural identifiability proofs are rigorous and the connection between continuous SDEs and discrete Euler SEMs via infinitesimal generators is elegant. However, the inability to handle instantaneous effects and linear scaling with sequence length are significant practical limitations that substantially restrict the method's applicability to many real-world causal discovery problems where these phenomena are important. The experimental validation is generally convincing but uses pragmatic workarounds (time series concatenation) and relatively modest datasets. The paper makes meaningful contributions to continuous-time causal discovery but the limitations prevent it from being a strong accept; it represents an incremental advance in a specific setting rather than a broadly applicable solution.",
