  "summary": "This paper proposes TGC, a general framework for deep temporal graph clustering that adapts clustering techniques to interaction sequence-based batch processing patterns. The framework introduces two clustering modules (node-level distribution and batch-level reconstruction) to suit temporal graphs, contrasting them with static graph clustering approaches.",
  "strengths": [
    "Addresses an underexplored but important problem of temporal graph clustering with a novel batch-processing approach that naturally handles large-scale graphs",
    "Provides comprehensive analysis of differences between temporal and static graph clustering from multiple perspectives (complexity, data representation, processing patterns)",
    "Demonstrates memory efficiency advantages over static methods, with extensive GPU memory usage experiments showing significant improvements",
    "Shows transferability across different temporal graph learning methods (HTNE, TGN, TREND) with consistent improvements",
    "Contributes new datasets (arXivAI, arXivCS) and addresses the dataset scarcity issue in temporal graph clustering"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The clustering modules are relatively simple adaptations - node-level distribution uses standard t-distribution similarity and batch-level reconstruction is a basic cosine similarity constraint",
    "Performance improvements are often marginal compared to baselines, and the method doesn't consistently outperform across all datasets and metrics",
    "The temporal modeling relies entirely on existing HTNE method without novel temporal modeling contributions",
    "Some experimental comparisons are unfair - many static methods face OOM issues while temporal methods naturally avoid this through batch processing",
    "The theoretical analysis of complexity advantages could be more rigorous - the claim that O(|E|) < O(NÂ²) depends heavily on graph sparsity assumptions"

  "detailed_comments": "The paper tackles an important and understudied problem with a reasonable approach. The key insight about batch processing enabling better memory efficiency is valuable. However, the technical contributions are somewhat incremental - the clustering modules are straightforward adaptations of existing techniques. While the experimental evaluation is comprehensive, the performance gains are often modest. The work would benefit from more sophisticated clustering modules and stronger theoretical foundations for the complexity claims.",
