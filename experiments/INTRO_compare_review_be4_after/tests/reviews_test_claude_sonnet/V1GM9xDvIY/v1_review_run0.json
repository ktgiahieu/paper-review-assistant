  "summary": "This paper introduces SCOTCH, a novel structure learning method that combines neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with variational inference to infer causal structures from temporal observations. The approach handles irregularly sampled time series and provides theoretical guarantees for structural identifiability and consistency. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improvements over baselines including discrete-time methods and ODE-based approaches.",
  "strengths": [
    "Novel and well-motivated approach: The paper addresses a significant limitation of existing structure learning methods by using continuous-time SDEs rather than discrete-time models or ODEs, enabling proper handling of irregularly sampled data and intrinsic stochasticity.",
    "Strong theoretical contributions: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis including structural identifiability results (Theorems 1-2) and consistency guarantees (Theorem 3), with detailed proofs in the appendix. The diagonal diffusion assumption is well-justified for identifiability.",
    "Comprehensive experimental evaluation: The experiments cover diverse datasets (Lorenz-96, Glycolysis, DREAM3, Netsim) and include comparisons with multiple baselines. The failure case demonstration (Figure 5) effectively illustrates limitations of ODE-based approaches like NGM.",
    "Clear presentation: The paper is generally well-written with good motivation, clear problem formulation, and helpful connections to related work (especially the discussion of Rhino as a discrete analog).",
    "Practical relevance: The method addresses real-world challenges including irregular sampling and multiple time series, which are common in applications like biology and healthcare."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Limited scope of identifiability: The diagonal diffusion assumption (Assumption 2) is quite restrictive and may not hold in many real-world systems with correlated noise across variables. The paper doesn't thoroughly discuss when this assumption is reasonable or how violations might affect performance.",
    "Computational scalability concerns: The paper mentions linear scaling with series length as a limitation but provides no computational complexity analysis, runtime comparisons, or discussion of scalability to high-dimensional systems. Training for 30,000 epochs (Glycolysis) suggests significant computational cost.",
    "Missing important capabilities: The inability to handle instantaneous effects is a significant limitation acknowledged by the authors, particularly problematic for the Netsim dataset where Rhino performs nearly perfectly. The intervention framework (Appendix 12) is presented but not empirically validated.",
    "Experimental limitations: (1) Concatenation strategy for adapting single-series baselines (NGM, CUTS) may unfairly disadvantage them; (2) Missing probability settings (p=0.3, 0.6) are relatively mild; (3) No ablation studies on key design choices like network architectures or the latent formulation; (4) Some baseline numbers are cited rather than reproduced (CUTS on DREAM3).",
    "Theoretical gaps: While consistency is proven in the infinite data limit, finite-sample guarantees are absent. The expressive posterior assumption (Assumption 4) is strong and its practical verification is unclear. The connection between Euler discretization results and continuous-time identifiability could be more rigorous."

  "detailed_comments": "This is a solid contribution to causal discovery from time series. The main innovation—using SDEs with variational inference for structure learning—is well-motivated and addresses real limitations of existing methods. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and the experiments demonstrate clear improvements over baselines. However, several concerns prevent a strong accept: (1) the diagonal diffusion assumption is quite restrictive; (2) computational costs are not adequately discussed; (3) the inability to handle instantaneous effects limits applicability; (4) experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive with ablations and scalability analysis. The paper would benefit from: discussing the practical implications and detection of assumption violations, providing computational complexity analysis and runtime comparisons, conducting ablation studies on key design choices, and validating the intervention framework empirically. Despite these limitations, the paper makes sufficient contributions to warrant acceptance, particularly given the novel continuous-time formulation and strong theoretical foundations.",
