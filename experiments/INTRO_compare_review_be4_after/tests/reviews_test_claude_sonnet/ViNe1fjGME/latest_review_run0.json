  "summary": "This paper proposes TGC, a framework for deep temporal graph clustering that adapts clustering techniques to interaction sequence-based batch-processing patterns. The authors discuss differences between temporal and static graph clustering, introduce two clustering modules (node-level distribution and batch-level reconstruction), and demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on six datasets including two newly constructed large-scale datasets (arXivAI and arXivCS).",
  "strengths": [
    "Addresses an important and under-explored problem of clustering on temporal graphs, providing comprehensive discussion from multiple perspectives (intuition, complexity, data, experiments)",
    "Proposes a general framework that can be applied to different temporal graph learning methods (demonstrated with HTNE, TGN, TREND), showing good transferability",
    "Introduces two novel datasets (arXivAI and arXivCS) suitable for temporal graph clustering research, addressing a key limitation in the field",
    "Demonstrates clear memory efficiency advantages over static graph clustering methods, with detailed complexity analysis showing O(|E|) vs O(NÂ²) complexity",
    "Comprehensive experimental evaluation including ablation studies, parameter sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with 15 baseline methods across multiple metrics"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The novelty of individual components is limited - the temporal module uses existing HTNE method without modification, and clustering modules adapt existing techniques (Student's t-distribution, cosine similarity) rather than introducing fundamentally new approaches",
    "The batch-level reconstruction module is acknowledged as a 'simple' and 'pseudo-reconstruction' that doesn't fully restore adjacency matrix reconstruction, raising questions about its theoretical soundness",
    "Performance improvements are inconsistent - TGC doesn't achieve best results on all datasets (e.g., Brain dataset), and gains vary significantly across datasets, suggesting limited generalization",
    "Writing quality issues including grammatical errors ('adjacency matrix-based node clustering modules are no longer applicable'), unclear motivations in places, and some redundancy between main paper and appendix",
    "The paper lacks discussion of failure cases and provides limited theoretical analysis of when and why the proposed approach works better than alternatives"

  "detailed_comments": "This paper tackles an important but under-explored problem of temporal graph clustering. The main contribution is not in algorithmic novelty but in systematically studying this problem and providing a practical framework. The experimental evaluation is thorough with good coverage of datasets and baselines. However, the technical novelty is limited as the approach primarily adapts existing techniques. The memory efficiency advantages are clear and valuable, but performance gains are inconsistent across datasets. The paper would benefit from: (1) deeper theoretical analysis of when temporal clustering provides advantages, (2) better writing quality and organization, (3) more discussion of limitations and failure modes. Despite these weaknesses, the comprehensive study, new datasets, and demonstrated practical benefits make this a borderline acceptable contribution that could stimulate further research in this area.",
